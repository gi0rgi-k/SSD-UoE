# Unit 9: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment


## Description

In Unit 9 I deepend my knowledge in creating and interacting with APIs. The unit emphasized the application of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, which are fundamental for backend development and essential for building robust, user-interactive systems. By implementing an API with Pythonâ€™s Flask library, the hands-on exercises provided valuable insight into designing modular and reusable back-end code.

The exploration of Flask highlighted its simplicity and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for rapid development of lightweight APIs. By creating and managing user records through endpoints, the exercises demonstrated how APIs act as a bridge between back-end systems and user interfaces. This practical experience helped with understanding how APIs support distributed architectures.

The unit also introduced the concept of ontologies in standardizing service deployments. This emphasized the importance of structured data representation and its role in interoperability across distributed systems. Reflection on this highlighted how a well-designed ontology can streamline data exchange and reduce integration complexities.
