# Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design
## Description

Unit 3 provided a  exploration of the history, concepts, and design of programming languages, offering valuable insights into their evolution and the principles shaping modern software development. 

One of the key takeaways was the historical journey of programming languages, beginning with the pioneering work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church - the progression from machine code to assembly languages like those used in EDSAC and business-oriented languages such as COBOL highlighted how programming languages evolved to address the growing complexity of computing needs. Understanding this trajectory clarified how modern languages like Python, Java, and C++ have inherited and expanded upon these foundational principles. The unit also delved into critical programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Using Python as an illustrative example, concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction were explored. 

Security challenges in programming - common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, and improper memory management were examined, along with best practices to mitigate these risks. Through hands-on coding nad comparisons of Python and C, I gained a deeper appreciation for Pythonâ€™s built-in safety mechanisms, such as dynamic memory management and strict boundary checks, which reduce the likelihood of such errors. Additionally, static analysis tools like Pylint were highlighted as effective means of improving code quality and identifying potential issues early in development.

We also held a team meeting to discuss secure eShop design for the group assignment and incorporated my peer feedback in my Initial Post of Unit 1 assignment.
