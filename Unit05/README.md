# Unit 5: An Introduction to Testing
## Description

Unit 5 provided a comprehensive introduction to software testing, emphasizing its dual role in assessing general quality and ensuring security. 

The exploration of key terms and testing techniques offered for understanding the complexities of software testing. By examining industry standards such as OWASP and ISO/IEC/IEEE, we gained insight into established best practices that are widely used to identify vulnerabilities and improve software resilience. These standards not only highlight the critical importance of security but also provide a framework for integrating testing practices into the development lifecycle.

A particularly valuable aspect of the unit was the focus on designing effective test plans and to think critically about potential attack surfaces and how to address them through testing strategies such as penetration testing, vulnerability testing, and performance analysis.

The practical elements of the unit, including the use of Python tools for testing and automation, were equally impactful. Learning about linters and tools like Bandit demonstrated how automation can streamline the testing process, ensuring consistent adherence to secure coding practices. These tools underscore the efficiency and reliability that modern frameworks bring to software testing.
