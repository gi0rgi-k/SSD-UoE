# Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems
## Description

Unit 7 provided a comprehensive understanding of operating systems (OS) and their role in bridging hardware, applications, and security.  Exploring examples of common operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS, I learned how different OSes cater to varying needs, emphasizing their respective strengths in security, usability, and performance.

A key takeaway was understanding the differences between processes, threads, and schedulers. Processes represent independent execution units, while threads are subdivisions within a process that share resources. Schedulers, on the other hand, manage the efficient execution of these entities. This understanding highlighted the complexities in ensuring smooth and secure multitasking.

I also gained a hands-on experience on creating REST API and applications with CRUD functions in Python with Unit's exercises. These will be crucial for my summarative assessment 2, in developing a secure eShop application.
