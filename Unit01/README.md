# Unit 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development
## Description

In Unit 1, I gained foundational knowledge about secure software development, exploring how traditional methods like Waterfall differ from modern Agile approaches in addressing security challenges. I was particularly interested in Agile's iterative nature and its ability to adapt to dynamic environments while fostering collaboration and responsiveness, as I have also adapted this framework at my work as a Product Manager and have experienced its superiority over waterfall in fostering efficiency, quicker feedback loop and improving collbaration. This reinforced the idea that secure software development requires not just technical expertise but also a flexible and team-oriented methodology.

Learning about UML provided me with a practical tool for breaking down complex designs into manageable components. I practiced creating flowcharts for my Initial Post to represent registration and login processes, which would be harder to demonstrate in writting. This proved how such techniques can improve communication between different stakeholders.

Additionally, the unit underscored the importance of fostering a risk-aware culture within organizations. I came to appreciate that developing secure software extends beyond coding practices â€” it requires a mindset where all team members proactively identify and mitigate risks. For example, reviewing the OWASP Top Ten weaknesses emphasized the critical need to recognize common vulnerabilities during development. Furthermore, the introduction to secure Scrum practices highlighted how security principles can be integrated into iterative development processes, aligning technical  and business goals with compliance and security frameworks.

Finally, we established our team. We created a WhatsApp group for adhoc communication, signed a team contract, and set up a shared Google Drive folder for collaboration.
