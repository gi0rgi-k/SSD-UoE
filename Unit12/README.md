# Unit 12: The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited

## Description

Unit 12 offered a thought-provoking conclusion to the module by revisiting the foundational Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate on monolithic vs. microkernel operating systems, placing it within the modern context of distributed systems and microservices. The discussion revealed how the trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and modularity remain critical, especially in times of frequent cyber-attacks.

The reflection on microservices versus monoliths underscored the importance of scalability, maintainability, and resilience in modern system design. Microservices, often resembling the principles of microkernels, align well with today's distributed architectures but introduce complexities like inter-service communication and security challenges. Conversely, monolithic systems emphasize performance and simplicity, which may still be relevant in specific use cases.

By revisiting faceted data approaches and advancements in secure programming, the unit emphasized how emerging paradigms can tackle the growing complexity of modern systems. This week encapsulated the broader themes of the module: understanding the interplay of design, security, and scalability in developing robust, future-proof software. The unit inspired critical thinking about system architecture decisions, backed by technical understanding and real-world relevance. 

Finally, I wrote a Reflective piece on the module summarising my whole learning progress throughout it.
