# Unit 11: Future trends in Secure Software Development

## Description

Unit 11 offered a comprehensive look at emerging trends and future directions in secure software development. It explored cutting-edge concepts like Fog Computing, IoT, and Cyber-Physical Systems, emphasizing their growing importance in modern architectures. These technologies present new security challenges, such as managing data at the edge and securing interconnected devices, which demand innovative solutions. The unit also revisited key concepts from previous weeks, contextualizing them within future trends like secure design patterns, advancements in programming languages, and operating systems. 

By reflecting on the eShop code, it became evident how foundational secure practices integrate into these evolving domains. This unit was most challenging and interesting both in terms of functional application development and security features. It was a culmination of all of my learnings in Computer Science until now.
