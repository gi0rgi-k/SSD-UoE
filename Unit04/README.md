# Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts
## Description

Unit 4 provided an in-depth exploration of two fundamental programming concepts—regular expressions (regex) and recursion—and their significant implications for system security. Through hands-on exercises and theoretical understanding, I gained valuable insights into how these concepts can be used to mitigating security risks.

Regular Expressions
The exercises on regex demonstrated their power in validating and parsing data formats, such as UK postcodes, with precision and flexibility. Regex is an indispensable tool for handling complex text processing tasks efficiently. However, I also learned that poorly constructed or overly complex regex patterns could lead to security vulnerabilities like Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). By following best practices, such as limiting input lengths and avoiding nested quantifiers, one can ensure secure input validation with regex.

Recursion
Solving the Tower of Hanoi problem highlighted the elegance and efficiency of recursion in solving problems with repetitive structures. However, I also recognized its limitations, such as stack overflow risks when handling deep recursive calls. This has critical implications for system reliability, especially in applications requiring high scalability or running on limited-resource environments. Mitigating these risks involves implementing iterative solutions where possible or enforcing recursion depth limits.

In this unit, I also collaborated with the team where we refined addittional details of the design of Secure eShop (for summarative assessment 1). The recording of the meeting is uploaded on Youtube and linked in the README.md file of this unit.
