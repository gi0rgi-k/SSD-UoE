# Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures

## Description

Unit 10 provided valuable insights into the evolution of system architectures, emphasizing the shift from monolithic deployments to distributed systems, microservices, and virtualized environments. The session highlighted the strengths and vulnerabilities of these architectures, particularly the expanded attack surface in distributed systems. Exploring security challenges unique to virtual environments, underscored the need for robust encryption and key distribution techniques to protect sensitive data. 

I also learned about  advantages and disadvantage of working with Faceted Data and created a simulation of python code as an example.
