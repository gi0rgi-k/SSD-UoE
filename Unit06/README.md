# Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing
## Description

Unit 6 provided valuable insights into the use of linters as tools to ensure high-quality and secure Python code. This unit emphasized the importance of maintaining consistent code design, identifying potential errors early, and adhering to Python's coding standards, which collectively contribute to creating robust and secure software.

During this unit, I explored various linters, including Pylint, Flake8, and McCabe, to analyze and improve Python code. Each linter offered unique feedback, highlighting the need for tailored tools depending on specific development scenarios. Through practical exercises, I corrected errors in Python code using linter feedback. I gained an appreciation for the role of structured feedback in enhancing code readability, reducing logical errors, and enforcing good practices like proper indentation and docstring usage. For instance, Flake8 flagged structural inconsistencies such as insufficient blank lines between functions, which, though minor, reinforced the discipline of following PEP 8 standards.

Finally, together with my team, we submitted our design document for secure eShop application which we will individually build for Unit 11.
