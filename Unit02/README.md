# Unit 2: UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning
## Description

Unit 2 provided valuable insights into leveraging Unified Modeling Language (UML) to support secure system planning, emphasizing the critical role of it in improving communication between stakeholders during software development. One key takeaway was recognizing opportunities to integrate security practices at every stage of the agile SDLC. By aligning the flexibility of agile with robust security principles, I learned how iterative approaches can adapt to evolving risks while maintaining a focus on delivering secure software. The exploration of software security challenges, particularly through examining ISO/IEC Standard 27000, enhanced my understanding of the language and frameworks critical to managing security risks effectively.

Additionally, reflecting on the role of human factors in cybersecurity illuminated the importance of fostering a risk-aware organizational culture. This aligns closely with managing insider threats, where education, clear policies, and continuous monitoring are essential. Overall, Unit 2 equipped me with practical skills and theoretical knowledge to approach secure software development holistically.
