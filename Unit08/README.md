# Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems

## Description

Unit 8 offered an insightful exploration of cryptography, emphasizing its crucial role in securing modern systems and its application in operating systems. By delving into cryptographic principles, the unit laid a strong foundation for understanding key concepts such as encryption, decryption, and hashing. The hands-on exercises provided an opportunity to implement and analyze encryption algorithms, including the Caesar Cipher and RSA, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

The integration of cryptographic libraries in Python, such as cryptography and pycrypto, was a key focus of the unit. These libraries demonstrate how developers can leverage robust tools to implement encryption and secure data. Through practical implementation, it became evident that while cryptographic libraries simplify development, improper use can lead to vulnerabilities, such as weak key management or reliance on outdated algorithms. This underscores the importance of understanding library documentation and best practices for secure implementation.
